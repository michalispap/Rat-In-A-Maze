# Rat-In-A-Maze
An implementation of a slightly altered version of the "Rat In A Maze" problem. The user inputs a text file of a specific format (just like the one here, where the first line contains the matrix and the second one the coordinates of 'E'), which includes a matrix (a.k.a "maze") with 0's, 1's and an 'E' (starting point) and, starting from 'E', we have to find an 'exit', which is represented by a 0 in the perimeter of the matrix. The "rat" can only move up, down, left and right, if the next position contains a 0. This specific implementation was constructed using a Stack, which was created using Nodes, a generic class I created. The idea behind the use of a stack data structure here is that, at some point, we have to utilize "backtracking", a concept that helps us "go back", in case the rat meets a dead-end.
